## Security Architecture

Steem Wallet Desktop implements a layered security model with strict separation between the user interface and cryptographic operations.

### Overview

```
+-------------------------------------+
|  React UI (Frontend)                |
|  - User interface rendering         |
|  - No access to private keys        |
|  - Communicates via IPC only        |
+----------------+--------------------+
                 |
                 | IPC Bridge (Type-safe)
                 |
+----------------v--------------------+
|  Tauri Core (OS Boundary)           |
+----------------+--------------------+
                 |
+----------------v--------------------+
|  Rust Backend (Secure Environment)  |
|                                     |
|  crypto.rs                          |
|  - AES-256-GCM encryption           |
|  - Argon2id key derivation          |
|  - Cryptographically secure RNG     |
|                                     |
|  storage.rs                         |
|  - Encrypted key storage            |
|  - Session management               |
+-------------------------------------+
```

### Encryption Details

**Algorithm: AES-256-GCM**
- NIST-approved authenticated encryption
- 256-bit key length
- Galois/Counter Mode provides both confidentiality and integrity
- Each encryption operation uses a unique 96-bit nonce

**Key Derivation: Argon2id**
- OWASP-recommended password hashing algorithm
- Resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks
- Parameters: 19456 KB memory, 2 iterations, 1 parallelism
- Produces 32-byte derived keys

### IPC Boundary Protection

The Inter-Process Communication (IPC) boundary ensures that:
- The frontend JavaScript environment cannot directly access private keys
- All cryptographic operations execute in the Rust backend
- Type-safe command interfaces prevent arbitrary code execution
- Even if the frontend is compromised (XSS), private keys remain protected

---

## Local Storage

### How Data is Stored

Steem Wallet Desktop uses a secure storage system implemented in Rust that differs significantly from browser-based localStorage.

**Desktop Application (Tauri)**
- Private keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
- The encryption key is derived from the user's password using Argon2id
- Encrypted data is stored in the application's data directory
- Storage location varies by OS:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\com.steemwallet.desktop\`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.steemwallet.desktop/`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/com.steemwallet.desktop/`

**Storage Flow**
```
User Password
     |
     v
Argon2id Key Derivation (salt + password)
     |
     v
256-bit Encryption Key
     |
     v
AES-256-GCM Encryption
     |
     v
Encrypted Data -> Application Data Directory
```

### What is Stored

| Data Type | Storage Method | Encryption |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Private Keys | Encrypted in app data | AES-256-GCM |
| Account Username | Plain text | No |
| App Settings | Plain text | No |
| Session Data | Memory only | Cleared on exit |

### Session Management

- Sensitive data is held in memory during active sessions
- Session data is cleared when the application closes
- Auto-lock feature clears session after configurable inactivity period (optional, user-enabled)
- Password cache automatically expires after 30 minutes of no key operations
- Logout completely clears all encrypted keys, password cache, and session data
- Password re-entry required to decrypt keys after lock

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices for Users

1. **Use a strong, unique password** - The security of your encrypted keys depends on password strength
2. **Keep your password safe** - There is no password recovery; losing your password means losing access to stored keys
3. **Verify downloads** - Only download releases from official sources
4. **Keep the application updated** - Updates may include security patches

### Security Model Limitations

- The application trusts the operating system's security
- If your device is compromised at the OS level, encrypted data may be at risk
- The application does not protect against keyloggers or screen capture malware
- Physical access to an unlocked device may expose data

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainers directly.
